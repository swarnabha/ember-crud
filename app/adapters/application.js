  // ^^^^ this is where you put the URL to your API.

// An adapter tells Ember Data where to send API requests, how to format them,
// and what to do with the responses.
// All outgoing API requests will use this adapter by default because it is named 'application'.
// The ember cli generates a JSONAPI Adapter. Other common adapter types are REST and JSON.
// JSONAPI is a special, standardized format for requests. See http://jsonapi.org/
// Ember Data will do all the hard work of making requests follow that specification.
